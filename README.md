# Entrata API for Node

This is a work in progress, I am basically adding endpoints as I need them.

I figure I might as well make it public, if you want to contribute, feel free to submit a pull request.

## Usage

```bash
npm install -s git@github.com:markhamilton/node-entrata.git
```

Check test.js for general usage. Unfortunately I don't have time to make more robust documentation.
